3A for unit testing: Arrange, Act and Assert

Describe the component you want to test and use a () => {} call back method.
Use beforeEach (()=>{}) to do the set up for all testing.
Use it ('description of the test', ()=> {}) to do a specific test
Use describe ('group name', ()=> {}) to group testes together
